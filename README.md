# Frontend Test Challenge

**Duration:** 1 week

## Introduction

Welcome to the **infinion_cohort** frontend repository! This project is part of a full-stack application, with the backend already completed and documented. You will focus on developing the frontend using **Vue 3** with **Vite**. The project will connect to a set of predefined API endpoints as documented in Swagger.

## Project Overview

This frontend application interacts with a REST API that provides data for our application. Your tasks include creating responsive and interactive components and pages based on design specifications and integrating them with the backend endpoints. Please read through the instructions carefully before beginning the challenge.

## Objective

Your task is to create a frontend interface based on the provided Figma design and integrate it with the backend API, following the requirements outlined below.
